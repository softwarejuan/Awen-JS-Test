# Awen Javascript Test
This is a simple test designed to ensure a baseline of JS programming ability. It should not take more than an hour.

## Getting started
You will need NodeJS installed, the latest LTS is recommended, but it should work with any fairly recent version https://nodejs.org/en/

When you first check out the repository, it will be necessary to install the required dependencies with:
```bash
npm ci
```

Once this has completed, you can run the app with
```bash
npm start
```

This will start a web server on http://localhost:5656/

## Completing the task
Once the server is running, the website will explain what needs to be completed. Feel free to create branches and check-ins in 
git as desired, but please do not push these to GitHub as this will allow other candidates to see your work. 

When you have finished, remove your node_modules folder and zip up the remaining. Send this zip file to hr@awencs.com with your name
and "JS Test" in the subject line.

## Other
### Changing the port
If for some reason you cannot use that port, you can specify another port to use with the command: 
```bash
PORT=1234 npm start
```
